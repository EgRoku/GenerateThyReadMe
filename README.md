## Description 

Your GitHub profile is important as a developer. A good profile allows you to have your work in one place for other developers and potential employers to view. An important component of any GitHub repo is the README file.

The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad one. A good Readme takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, and talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

With this README generator, you no longer need to create a professional README from scratch. Simply answer a few questions and watch as a README is created before your very eyes.
